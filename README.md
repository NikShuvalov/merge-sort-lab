## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be completed in small groups of 2-3._

This lab will help you gain more practice using Merge Sort.

## Exercise

Similar to previous bubble and insertion sort labs, this lab will provide practice manually executing the Merge Sort algorithm.

There are 6 arrays listed below. For each one, draw out the Merge Sort diagram, showing each step of your process as you split up the array - also, include the steps needed to merge everything back together.

**[-5,20,3,2,22]**

**[4,-4,3,-3,1,0]**

**[-3,1,0,0,5,2]**

**[1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]**

**[1,-5,77,28,15,91,-8,23,52,44,140,14,23,41]**

**[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]**

#### Bonus

Read about the [Quick Sort algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/quick_sort_algorithm.htm), another divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. Pick two (or more) of the unsorted arrays above and draw out the steps to sort them using Quick Sort.

## Deliverable

Take pictures of the diagram for each practice problem and include those pictures are part of your submitted pull request. Or, type them up in a text file if you prefer, and submit that with your pull request.
